      {
        category: "Product Basics & Hardware",
        question: "What does the motion sensor on ChatrBox do, and how does it detect my pet?",
        answer: `The front motion sensor detects your pet’s movement by sensing subtle changes in body heat as your pet moves through cooler air. When your pet enters the detection zone you’ve set, ChatrBox automatically plays your recorded command to guide or correct their behavior.`
      },
      {
        category: "Product Basics & Hardware",
        question: "Why does ChatrBox use yellow and blue LED lights?",
        answer: `Dogs and most pets can see yellow and blue but are colorblind to reds and greens. These LED colors stand out to them and help draw their attention to your message, improving communication during training.`
      },
      {
        category: "Product Basics & Hardware",
        question: "What do the LED lights indicate during operation?",
        answer: `The LEDs flash during motion-triggered events and also serve as visual indicators when ChatrBox is powering on, recording, or in Detection Pause / setup modes.`
      },
      {
        category: "Product Basics & Hardware",
        question: "What is Detection Pause Mode?",
        answer: `Detection Pause Mode temporarily disables triggering while you’re positioning or aiming the device. A pulsing blue LED indicates the unit is powered on but paused. You can unpause detection when you’re ready for ChatrBox to start monitoring your pet.`
      },
      {
        category: "Product Basics & Hardware",
        question: "Where is the speaker located, and what does it do?",
        answer: `A built-in speaker on the front plays your recorded command and system prompts that guide you through setup and use. It’s designed for clear, consistent audio output.`
      },
      {
        category: "Product Basics & Hardware",
        question: "Where are the control buttons, and what are they used for?",
        answer: `The control buttons are located on the front of the unit. They let you power the device on or off, record voice messages, adjust volume, switch between training modes, and access advanced features.`
      },
      {
        category: "Product Basics & Hardware",
        question: "Does ChatrBox have a built-in microphone?",
        answer: `Yes. A built-in microphone allows you to record custom voice commands up to 20 seconds long.`
      },
      {
        category: "Product Basics & Hardware",
        question: "What powers ChatrBox?",
        answer: `ChatrBox can be powered by four AAA batteries (included) or a USB-C cable (included) connected to any standard 5V USB wall adapter (not included).`
      },
      {
        category: "Product Basics & Hardware",
        question: "How long do the batteries last?",
        answer: `Under typical use, four AAA batteries last up to about 90 days and hundreds of training events.`
      },
      {
        category: "Product Basics & Hardware",
        question: "How do I install the batteries?",
        answer: `1. Remove the back battery cover using a coin to gently pry it loose.
2. Follow the orientation markings inside the compartment.
3. Insert all four AAA batteries.
4. Snap the cover back into place until it clicks.`
      },
      {
        category: "Product Basics & Hardware",
        question: "How do I power on ChatrBox?",
        answer: `Press and hold the Power button for several seconds until you hear “Power On.” The blue LED will begin pulsing, indicating the device is on and in Detection Pause Mode.`
      },
      {
        category: "Product Basics & Hardware",
        question: "Can I use ChatrBox indefinitely by plugging it in?",
        answer: `Yes. When connected to a 5V DC USB wall adapter via the USB-C cable, ChatrBox can run continuously without relying on batteries.`
      },
      {
        category: "Product Basics & Hardware",
        question: "What is the removable stand used for?",
        answer: `The removable stand on the bottom attaches using universal mount hardware so you can mount ChatrBox on tripods, universal brackets, or other accessories. This helps with precise placement during training.`
      },

      /* === Recording Your Commands === */
      {
        category: "Recording Your Commands",
        question: "How do I record a message for my pet?",
        answer: `1. Press and hold the Record button.
2. You’ll hear the prompt: “Record Message.”
3. Speak clearly 10–12 inches from the device in the same tone you use when talking to your pet.
4. Release the Record button when finished.

A red LED lights up while recording is active.`
      },
      {
        category: "Recording Your Commands",
        question: "How long can my recording be?",
        answer: `You can record messages up to 20 seconds long, but short, firm, consistent commands usually work best.`
      },
      {
        category: "Recording Your Commands",
        question: "What types of messages work best?",
        answer: `Simple, natural commands such as:
• “No.”
• “Off the couch, Buster.”
• “Out of the kitchen, Max.”

Short phrases you’d normally say to your pet are most effective.`
      },
      {
        category: "Recording Your Commands",
        question: "How do I listen to my recording?",
        answer: `After recording, ChatrBox automatically plays your message back once. You can replay it anytime by double-pressing the Record button.`
      },
      {
        category: "Recording Your Commands",
        question: "How do I redo a message if I don’t like the first one?",
        answer: `Just record a new message using the same steps. ChatrBox automatically replaces the previous recording—there’s no need to delete anything manually.`
      },
      {
        category: "Recording Your Commands",
        question: "How do I know if my message recorded correctly?",
        answer: `A red LED lights during recording, and the device plays the message when it’s saved. You can double-press the Record button to replay and confirm clarity.`
      },
      {
        category: "Recording Your Commands",
        question: "What’s the best way to make sure my message is effective?",
        answer: `Speak clearly 10–12 inches from the microphone, use your natural correction tone, keep the message short and consistent, and replay it to ensure it’s easy for your pet to recognize.`
      },
      {
        category: "Recording Your Commands",
        question: "What happens after I finish recording?",
        answer: `Your message is saved automatically and becomes the active training command. From there you can adjust playback volume, choose a training mode, and fine-tune the detection area with aiming and Focus Shields.`
      },

      /* === Training Modes & Behavior Control === */
      {
        category: "Training Modes & Behavior Control",
        question: "How many training modes does ChatrBox have?",
        answer: `ChatrBox has three distinct training modes. You can switch between them by quickly pressing the Record button, which changes how ChatrBox responds when your pet enters the detection area.`
      },
      {
        category: "Training Modes & Behavior Control",
        question: "How does ChatrBox respond when my pet enters the detection zone?",
        answer: `Depending on the selected mode, ChatrBox may respond with flashing LED lights, your recorded voice command, attention-getting sound effects, or a combination of these. The exact response pattern depends on the training mode.`
      },
      {
        category: "Training Modes & Behavior Control",
        question: "What is Training Mode One?",
        answer: `Training Mode One is the default and most assertive correction mode. On the first detection, LEDs flash blue/yellow and your voice command plays. If your pet stays in the area, ChatrBox escalates by adding attention-grabbing sound effects plus your command. If they still remain, a stronger sequence of sound effects and your voice plays. Escalations can repeat up to five cycles before ChatrBox resets.`
      },
      {
        category: "Training Modes & Behavior Control",
        question: "Who is Training Mode One best for?",
        answer: `Mode One is ideal for new training situations, stubborn or persistent behaviors, pets that ignore softer corrections, and pets that linger around off-limits areas. Most pets respond within the first or second alert; the third almost always works.`
      },
      {
        category: "Training Modes & Behavior Control",
        question: "How many times can ChatrBox escalate in Mode One?",
        answer: `Mode One can escalate up to five times before automatically resetting to normal monitoring mode.`
      },
      {
        category: "Training Modes & Behavior Control",
        question: "What happens when my pet finally leaves the detection area?",
        answer: `At any stage in any mode, all lights, sound effects, and voice commands stop instantly once your pet exits the detection zone.`
      },
      {
        category: "Training Modes & Behavior Control",
        question: "What is Training Mode Two?",
        answer: `Training Mode Two uses a gentler approach. It plays a calm alert tone with no flashing lights and no voice command, making it ideal for pets that already know the rules but occasionally need a reminder.`
      },
      {
        category: "Training Modes & Behavior Control",
        question: "When should I use Training Mode Two?",
        answer: `Mode Two is best for maintenance training, pets that no longer need strong correction, situations where you prefer a subtle deterrent, or when you want to reduce overstimulation in sensitive pets.`
      },
      {
        category: "Training Modes & Behavior Control",
        question: "What is Training Mode Three?",
        answer: `Training Mode Three focuses entirely on your recorded voice. It plays your command only—no flashing lights and no alert tones—making it ideal for pets that respond reliably to your voice alone.`
      },
      {
        category: "Training Modes & Behavior Control",
        question: "Can Training Mode Three be used for positive reinforcement?",
        answer: `Yes. You can record calming or encouraging messages such as “Good girl, Daisy—you’re a good girl!” ChatrBox can then play your message to reassure or reward your pet even when you’re not home.`
      },
      {
        category: "Training Modes & Behavior Control",
        question: "Which mode is best for new pets or stubborn behaviors?",
        answer: `Training Mode One, because it provides escalating correction for firm behavioral reinforcement.`
      },
      {
        category: "Training Modes & Behavior Control",
        question: "Which mode is best for pets that already know the rules?",
        answer: `Training Mode Two, which offers a gentle reminder without overstimulation.`
      },
      {
        category: "Training Modes & Behavior Control",
        question: "Which mode is best for pets that respond primarily to voice?",
        answer: `Training Mode Three, since it plays only your recorded command.`
      },
      {
        category: "Training Modes & Behavior Control",
        question: "How do I change the training mode?",
        answer: `Short-press the Record button. Each press cycles to the next mode. The system announces “Training Mode One,” “Training Mode Two,” or “Training Mode Three.” Stop pressing when you hear the mode you want.`
      },
      {
        category: "Training Modes & Behavior Control",
        question: "Does ChatrBox remember the last training mode I selected?",
        answer: `Yes. ChatrBox stays in the selected mode until you change it again, even if you power the device off and back on.`
      },
      {
        category: "Training Modes & Behavior Control",
        question: "How can I confirm which mode is active?",
        answer: `You can manually trigger the device and observe its response: lights + voice + escalation indicate Mode One, alert tone only indicates Mode Two, and voice-only playback indicates Mode Three.`
      },
      {
        category: "Training Modes & Behavior Control",
        question: "Does ChatrBox still monitor the area between alerts?",
        answer: `Yes. After each alert sequence, ChatrBox checks whether your pet has left the detection zone. If they have, it resets and returns to normal monitoring.`
      },

      /* === Volume Control & Sound Quality === */
      {
        category: "Volume Control & Sound Quality",
        question: "How many volume levels does ChatrBox have?",
        answer: `ChatrBox has five adjustable volume levels, from Level 1 (lowest) to Level 5 (highest).`
      },
      {
        category: "Volume Control & Sound Quality",
        question: "How do I change the volume on ChatrBox?",
        answer: `Use the Volume button on the device. Each click changes the volume level one step at a time.`
      },
      {
        category: "Volume Control & Sound Quality",
        question: "How does the volume cycle work?",
        answer: `The volume cycles in a “zig-zag” pattern: as it moves up, it goes Level 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5. The next click moves it down 5 → 4 → 3 → 2 → 1. From Level 1, it starts moving up again. This lets you fine-tune the volume without looping all the way around.`
      },
      {
        category: "Volume Control & Sound Quality",
        question: "How do I know which volume level I’m on?",
        answer: `After each click, ChatrBox announces the current setting with a voice prompt such as “Volume Level 4” or “Volume Level 5.”`
      },
      {
        category: "Volume Control & Sound Quality",
        question: "Does the system voice change loudness with the volume level?",
        answer: `Yes. The system voice gets louder or softer with each change, giving you a real-time preview of how loud your training message will sound at that level.`
      },
      {
        category: "Volume Control & Sound Quality",
        question: "What determines how loud my pet hears the message?",
        answer: `Two factors: how loudly or softly you recorded your voice command, and the volume level you select (1–5) on ChatrBox. A naturally loud recording at a high volume will sound much stronger than a soft recording at a low level.`
      },
      {
        category: "Volume Control & Sound Quality",
        question: "What if my recorded message sounds too loud or distorted?",
        answer: `If your message sounds harsh or distorted, lower the ChatrBox volume level and consider re-recording your message at a normal speaking level. You want the sound clear and crisp, not harsh.`
      },
      {
        category: "Volume Control & Sound Quality",
        question: "Do I need to shout when recording my command?",
        answer: `No. Dogs and cats hear much better than humans. Shouting can be unpleasant or overwhelming. Use a clear, firm, confident tone instead of raising your voice.`
      },
      {
        category: "Volume Control & Sound Quality",
        question: "What kind of voice tone works best for training?",
        answer: `Pets respond best to clear, confident, and consistent cues. Your tone and intonation matter more than raw volume. Speak the way you normally correct your pet in person.`
      },
      {
        category: "Volume Control & Sound Quality",
        question: "Why is it important to test the volume?",
        answer: `Testing ensures your message is loud enough for your pet to hear, not so loud that it’s uncomfortable, and free of distortion. This makes training more effective and less stressful for your pet.`
      },

      /* === Aiming, Placement & Coverage === */
      {
        category: "Aiming, Placement & Coverage",
        question: "What is the detection range of ChatrBox?",
        answer: `ChatrBox can detect motion up to about 20 feet away, making it suitable for small rooms, larger rooms, and open areas in your home.`
      },
      {
        category: "Aiming, Placement & Coverage",
        question: "What does the detection zone look like?",
        answer: `Think of the detection zone as an invisible cone that is narrow near the device and widens as it extends outward. The farther the target area is from the device, the wider the coverage; the closer it is, the tighter and more focused the detection zone.`
      },
      {
        category: "Aiming, Placement & Coverage",
        question: "How high should I place ChatrBox?",
        answer: `For best results, place ChatrBox at approximately your pet’s eye level and aim it toward the area where unwanted behavior occurs.`
      },
      {
        category: "Aiming, Placement & Coverage",
        question: "How should I position ChatrBox to protect furniture?",
        answer: `If your pet jumps on furniture when you’re away, you can place ChatrBox 2–3 feet in front of the furniture, angled slightly upward toward the path they use, or place it directly on the seat cushion pointing toward where your pet usually jumps up. Both positions are effective.`
      },
      {
        category: "Aiming, Placement & Coverage",
        question: "How do I use ChatrBox for indoor bathroom accidents?",
        answer: `Place ChatrBox a few feet away from the problem area where your pet tends to go. When your pet approaches, the motion sensor detects movement and plays your recorded message before they reach the spot, helping prevent repeat accidents.`
      },
      {
        category: "Aiming, Placement & Coverage",
        question: "How do I protect larger areas like a living room or kitchen?",
        answer: `Aim ChatrBox toward main entry paths such as doorways, hall entries, or pathways your pet uses to enter. This lets ChatrBox catch your pet as they enter, stopping them before they go deeper into the room or repeat bad behavior.`

      {
        category: "Pre-Training & Wi-Fi Control",
        question: "What is pre-training with ChatrBox?",
        answer: `Pre-training is a phase where you manually trigger ChatrBox while you’re present with your pet. You correct unwanted behavior in real time and then reward your pet when they respond correctly. This teaches your pet what your commands mean before ChatrBox operates automatically.`
      },
      {
        category: "Pre-Training & Wi-Fi Control",
        question: "Why is pre-training important?",
        answer: `Pre-training helps your pet understand your recorded command, associate it with specific behaviors (like not jumping on the couch), and connect correction with positive rewards. This creates a strong link between your voice, the correction, and the reward, making automatic training more effective.`
      },
      {
        category: "Pre-Training & Wi-Fi Control",
        question: "When is pre-training most useful?",
        answer: `Pre-training works best in situations you can see directly or monitor nearby, such as when your pet enters a restricted room, approaches the trash can, or heads toward the couch, countertops, or kitchen. You watch for the behavior to begin, then trigger ChatrBox at the right moment.`
      },
      {
        category: "Pre-Training & Wi-Fi Control",
        question: "How does manual triggering help my pet learn?",
        answer: `When you see unwanted behavior starting, you tap the Train button on your phone or tablet. ChatrBox plays your recorded command (and any sound cues), your pet stops or moves away, and you reward them with praise or a treat. This real-time correction and reward pattern accelerates learning and builds strong habits.`
      },
      {
        category: "Pre-Training & Wi-Fi Control",
        question: "How do I manually trigger ChatrBox from my phone or tablet?",

      {
        category: "Pre-Training & Wi-Fi Control",
        question: "How do I reward my pet during pre-training?",
        answer: `When your pet responds correctly by stopping, turning away, or leaving the area, praise them verbally and optionally offer a small treat. This reinforces that responding to your command is the correct behavior.`
      },
      {
        category: "Pre-Training & Wi-Fi Control",
        question: "Does every behavior need pre-training?",
        answer: `No. Some behaviors may not occur when you’re home or watching. For those, ChatrBox can still train automatically by responding whenever your pet enters the detection zone. Pre-training is a booster for behaviors you can observe live; automatic operation handles the rest.`
      },
      {
        category: "Pre-Training & Wi-Fi Control",
        question: "How does pre-training help once ChatrBox runs automatically?",
        answer: `After a few guided sessions, your pet learns what your command means, automatic triggers feel familiar rather than new, and your pet responds more quickly and naturally even when you’re not in the room. ChatrBox then maintains consistency by delivering your command whenever the behavior occurs.`
      },
      {
        category: "Pre-Training & Wi-Fi Control",
        question: "How do I end Wi-Fi control and return to normal operation?",
